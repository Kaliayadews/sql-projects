#Olympics Analysis (mySQL Project #1)

This project uses SQL to analyze historical Olympic Games data.  
It answers multiple questions (showcased within the code).

## Key Concepts Used
- `CASE WHEN` statements for conditional counting
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY`)
- Aggregation and filtering

## What I Learned
- How to rank rows within groups using `PARTITION BY`
- How to format output clearly using `CONCAT`
- How to simplify multi-step analysis using CTEs

## File
- `olympics_analysis.sql` â€“ full query with comments and structure

## Next Steps
- Add visualizations in Power BI
- Expand analysis
